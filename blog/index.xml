However, their opposite stances towards virtual environment usage makes using them together a little more cumbersome. In this note, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how I integrated Nox in my PDM workflow.
We will use Nox to automate testing on multiple Python versions during CI. We&amp;rsquo;d also like to run our tests using a similar command locally without having to maintain almost duplicate Nox sessions.</description></item><item><title>Conda Workflow</title><link>https://leroyvn.github.io/blog/conda_workflow/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 11:44:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://leroyvn.github.io/blog/conda_workflow/</guid><description>This page describes my Conda workflow.
Conda I use Conda as my environment and package manager. This choice is the outcome of a long professional history. Pros for choosing Conda:
it&amp;rsquo;s portable; it&amp;rsquo;s simple to use; it provides optimised binaries for several scientific packages; it saves space on my hard drive; it can install more than just Python stuff. Cons:
many packages are missing (and interoperability with Pip has many issues when one starts playing with dependency pinning); usually second-class citizen in CI workflows (see also previous point about deps pinning); Conda&amp;rsquo;s dependency resolution is slow; many people don&amp;rsquo;t use Conda.</description></item></channel></rss>
