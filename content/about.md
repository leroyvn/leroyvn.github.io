# About

## The Human Who Wrote This

I'm Vincent. I'm a research software engineer working for Brussels-based company [Rayference](https://www.rayference.eu/). I have a PhD in thermal sciences and I work now on radiative transfer modelling and simulation for Earth observation applications.

I'm an advocate of free software. I believe that sharing knowledge is required for a better understanding of what's around us. The benefits of secrecy are often misunderstood and I believe we can share more than we are used to think in many professional environments.

I'm a climate activist. You won't find me in many demonstrations, I'm more the kind who tries to make an impact by educating folks around them. Our civilisation is on a self-destructive path and getting out of it requires deep cultural changes, which can't be achieved only through conflict.

I'm a musician and a martial artist. I'm French, Belgium is my home: Pardon my English. ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
