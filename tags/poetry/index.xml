Conda I use Conda as my environment and package manager. This choice is the outcome of a long professional history. Pros for choosing Conda:
it&amp;rsquo;s portable; it&amp;rsquo;s simple to use; it provides optimised binaries for several scientific packages; it saves space on my hard drive; it can install more than just Python stuff. Cons:
many packages are missing (and interoperability with Pip has many issues when one starts playing with dependency pinning); usually second-class citizen in CI workflows (see also previous point about deps pinning); Conda&amp;rsquo;s dependency resolution is slow; many people don&amp;rsquo;t use Conda.</description></item></channel></rss>
